This repository is for the evaluation of [Perception Simplex](https://github.com/CPS-IL/perception_simplex). Please refer to the usage instructions at [Perception Simplex](https://github.com/CPS-IL/perception_simplex). The engineering version, uploaded and maintained by Simon Yu, is [available here](https://github.com/cpsintegrationlab/lgsvl_msgs).



This module computes the projections for
safety and mission layer detections and aids in
comparisons that eventually determine override decisions in Perception Simplex.
These projections and comparisons use the minimal
obstacle detection requirements established in [prior work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9978967).
